## Hi, I'm dongkyoung. ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Dongkyoung. My name carries the meaning of "strong longing for something," which is why my username is YearnBeyond. ðŸ’–âœ¨

I have experience 3 years of working as a framework engineer at TmaxSoft. 

I truly enjoy software engineering, and I'm always striving to find and apply better solutions through constant study and reflection.
At present, I have been interested in creating server development with Java and Spring Boot. 
I also frequently automate tasks needed for my work through shell scripting. ðŸš€

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate with me!
