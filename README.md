## Hi, there. ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Dongkyoung. 
My name reflects the idea of 'yearning beyond,' so I'm always chasing my dreams. 
I think that's what software engineering means to me." ðŸ’–âœ¨

- I have experience 3 years of working as a framework engineer at TmaxSoft. 

At present, I have been interested in creating server development with **Java** and **Spring Boot**. 
I also frequently automate tasks needed for my work through **shell scripting**. ðŸš€

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate with me!
